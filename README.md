A React Application that makes call to iTunes to retrieve specific song list and on clicking plays the song

# How to run on your device

2. Extract it and open its path on your terminal
3. In terminal write npm i to install the required dependencies
4. Do npm start to make it go live locally

# How does it work
1. Once the window opens you can see a search box and button on your screen
2. Upon inserting some value in search box and clicking the submit button you will see the results in table
3. On Double Clicking any row in the table you will be able to play the song visible on the top right if using on desktop
